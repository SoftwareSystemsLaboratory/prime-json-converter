## About

This is a mock project containing the base files and project structure for an *ssl-metrics Python 3.9 + project*.

## What Files Need to be Changed?

Every file (with the exception of the files listed below) need to have some change done to them. It should be obvious once each file is looked at.

However, these files would have to change anyways. So consider it a task instead of a chore 😊!

### DO NOT CHANGE THESE FILES

- Any `.gitkeep` file
- [LICENSE](LICENSE)
- [\_\_init__.py](ssl_metrics_MODULE_NAME/__init__.py)
- [.github/workflows/pypi.yml](.github/workflows/pypi.yml)
